# Question 2
# Plot the training data (your axes should be x1 and x2 , corresponding to the two coordinates of
# the inputs, and you should use a different symbol for each point plotted to indicate whether that example
# had label 1 or 0). Also plot on the same figure the decision boundary fit by logistic regression. (i.e.,
# this should be a straight line showing the boundary separating the region where h(x) > 0.5 from where
# h(x) â‰¤ 0.5.)
